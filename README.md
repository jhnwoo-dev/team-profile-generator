# team-profile-generator

## Description

The motivation for this project was to create an application that would take information on a software engineering team.
This was built to generate an HTML webpage that would display summaries for each person on the team.
This solves the problem of not being able to keep track of the people on the software engineering team.
I learned how to export and utilize classes from separate files, as well as how to call on functions from imported files.

## Installation

You will follow the normal GitHub cloning procedures to clone the repository to a local directory. Once you have your cloned files, run the command 'npm install' in the terminal to install all necessary files to run the project.

## Usage

You will run the command 'node index.js' in the integrated terminal - followed by prompts to answer questions regarding building a software engineering team. Select the correct prompts for yourself and input information as prompted. Once that has been completed, you may opt to finish building your team, which will generate an html page that has all the information regarding your team!
